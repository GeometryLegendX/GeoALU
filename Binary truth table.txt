here i will reffer as on: 1 and off: 0 and use a string of binary numbers: 1001 while in the build it is top down:
1
0
0
1
Just know that the first number of the string >1<001 the bottom lamp is in the 2 input sections

1  = 0001  
2  = 0010  
3  = 0011  
4  = 0100  
5  = 0101  
6  = 0110  
7  = 0111  
8  = 1000  
9  = 1001  
10 = 1010  
11 = 1011  
12 = 1100  
13 = 1101  
14 = 1110  
15 = 1111
